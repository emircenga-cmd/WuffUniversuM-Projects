# PROJECT MEMORY: Razvijanje Wuff Sistema (WUFF Orchestrator)

**GitHub:** https://github.com/emircenga-cmd/[TBD - repo name]
**Started:** 2025-01-01
**Status:** 🟡 Planning & Setup Phase

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build **WUFF Orchestrator** - an autonomous AI business orchestration system using "Neural Mesh" architecture that enables Claude (WUFF) to:
- Maintain persistent memory across sessions via Basic Memory MCP
- Delegate operational tasks to ClickUp Brain (COO) and Gemini (Research Head)
- Manage long-term projects autonomously using ECP Protocol (Evergreen Context Protocol)
- Operate as strategic CEO while coordinating specialized AI agents

---

## 📋 Current Status

**Phase:** Foundation Setup (Week 1 of 4-week implementation)

**What's Been Completed:**
- ✅ Architecture designed (Neural Mesh 4-layer system)
- ✅ Tech stack confirmed (Basic Memory v0.17.2, ClickUp subscribed, Gemini planned)
- ✅ Documentation created:
  - WUFF-MASTER-BLUEPRINT-v1.0.md (complete architecture)
  - WUFF-IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md (step-by-step tasks)
- ✅ ClickUp Space "WuffUniversuM OS" created (structure TBD - currently analyzing)

**Current Focus:**
- 🔄 Analyzing existing ClickUp Space structure
- 🔄 Setting up professional project tracking
- 🔄 Creating documentation foundation (PROJECT_MEMORY, RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS)

**Next Immediate Steps:**
1. Verify ClickUp Space structure aligns with Blueprint
2. Initialize Git repo for this project
3. Create CLAUDE_RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md
4. Update CLAUDE_MASTER_MEMORY.md with this project
5. Begin Week 1 implementation (folder structures)

## 🧠 Key Decisions & Rationale

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **3 Separate Knowledge Bases** | Each AI (WUFF/ClickUp/Gemini) has optimal KB type - local graph vs structured docs vs bulk data | 2025-01-01 |
| **Basic Memory Must Be Local** | MCP requires filesystem access, cannot use GDrive Stream mode | 2025-01-01 |
| **PARA Folder Structure** | Action-oriented organization (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) | 2025-01-01 |
| **Interview Method for KB** | Token efficiency + user control vs manual writing | 2025-01-01 |
| **File-Based Mission Briefs (Phase 1)** | Human Router latency acceptable initially, automate in Phase 2 | 2025-01-01 |
| **Separate C:\Projects\ from C:\AI-Team\** | Development vs Business orchestration - different protocols | 2025-01-01 |

## 📝 Session Notes

### Session 002 - 2025-01-01 (Project Setup)

**Goal:** Setup professional project tracking and documentation foundation

**Actions Taken:**
- Created PROJECT_MEMORY.md for progress tracking
- Analyzing ClickUp Space "WuffUniversuM OS" structure
- Planning Git repository initialization
- Preparing CLAUDE_RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md

**Decisions Made:**
- Use Desktop version of Claude Code for MCP connector access
- Verify ClickUp structure before proceeding with Week 1 tasks
- Create comprehensive session notes for continuity

**Blockers:**
- Need to verify ClickUp MCP connector functionality in Desktop app
- Awaiting ClickUp Space structure analysis

**Next Session:**
- Complete ClickUp structure verification
- Initialize Git repo and push to GitHub
- Create CLAUDE_RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- Begin Week 1 Task 1.1 (Basic Memory folder creation)

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

**This is NOT a coding project** - it's a **system assembly project**:
- Focus: Configuration, documentation, workflow design
- Outcome: Functional AI orchestration system
- Method: Step-by-step implementation following Blueprint
- Success Metric: WUFF autonomously manages projects by Week 4

**Critical Dependencies:**
1. Basic Memory MCP must remain functional
2. ClickUp subscription active (Standard + Brain Max)
3. Regular session checkpoints for continuity
4. Interview Method for knowledge gathering (not manual writing)

**Recovery Protocol:**
- If session breaks: Read CLAUDE_RESUME_INSTRUCTIONS.md (when created)
- If unclear on task: Reference WUFF-IMPLEMENTATION-CHECKLIST.md
- If need context: Reference WUFF-MASTER-BLUEPRINT-v1.0.md
- If need architecture: See Blueprint Section "Architecture Overview"

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-01
**Next Review:** After Week 1 completion (Day 7)
